<!-- Task 1: Edit the existing text section of your Markdown document to display at least three different heading sizes, layer them one on top of the other. --> 

## **R Markdown**

#This is my first R Markdown document is quite a while.  

###I want to make that I have everything set up and ready.  

####The first topic I am writing about is economic statistics in China. 

<!-- Task 2: Insert your name in the place of [Github Name], with no brackets. Italicize your github name, and make Geog458 bold. Finally, make the word "here" into a hyperlink, which goes to our Canvas main page (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1269928). --> 


This is *justin-ichiro-choi*'s first assignment for **Geog458**. Our course page can be accessed [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1269928).

<!-- Task 3 Finally, let's add an image with a caption. We will use an image from the web, to avoid local directory differences. You can use any image and caption you want (again, make it appropriate, this is public). But if you can't think of anything just use this long address for the UW logo, and caption it "this is where I study" or something:
  -->
  
  Here is where I study:

<!-- Task 4: LaTeX  -->

Here is the equation for the Law of Gravity. This was done in LaTeX:  

\[F= G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}\]

<!-- Task 5: Table
  2 columns headings, 
  6 content cells,
  includes a reference 
-->

#Loading the Data
This is how to load data into R and how to convert it. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
object1 <- read.csv("./China_EO_49to17.csv")
object2 = as_tibble(object1)

# Step 14
# ARranging the list by year, descending
object2 <- arrange(object2, desc(Year)) %>% as_tibble
object2

# Creating a new object which only has the data for Shanghai and Beijing from 2000-2017

object3 <- select(object2, starts_with("beijing"), starts_with("shanghai"), Year) %>% filter(Year >= 2000)

# Adding a column to new tibble that is the ratio of Beijing's Output to Shanghai

finalGraph <- mutate(object3, Output_Ratio = Beijing_Output / Shanghai_Output)

finalGraph

# Step 15: Create a function that 
getRecentData <- function(province1, province2) {
  dataset = object1
  
  # Filters table to columns that contain the province names.
  newTable <- select(dataset, starts_with(province1), starts_with(province2), Year) %>% filter(Year >= 2000)
  # Assumes that inputs are part of a province in China. Since this includes 4 columns + plus the date
  if(ncol(newTable) == 5) {
    # calculates the input/output ratio
    newTable$Input_Output <- newTable[,2] / newTable[,4]
  } else {
    # adds a new column to indicate that there isn't enough information to compute the ratio
    newTable <- mutate(newTable, Input_Output = "Insufficient data to compute")
  }
  return(as_tibble(newTable))  
}

coolStuff <- getRecentData("Shanghai","Tianjin")
coolStuff
